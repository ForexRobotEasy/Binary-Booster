## Code Overview

The code provided is a sample implementation of the Binary Booster trading strategy using the MQL (MetaQuotes Language) in the MetaTrader platform. It uses various functions and variables to generate buy and sell signals based on chart data.

### Libraries

The code includes the necessary Trade library, which provides functions for executing trades.

### Constants

- `BUY_SIGNAL`: Represents the buy signal.
- `SELL_SIGNAL`: Represents the sell signal.

### Variables

- `signal`: Stores the generated signal.
- `isCross`: Indicates if a blue cross signal is present.
- `isArrow`: Indicates if an arrow signal is present.

### Functions

1. `isWeakBuySignal()`: Checks if a weak buy signal is present.
2. `isStrongBuySignal()`: Checks if a strong buy signal is present.
3. `isSellSignal()`: Checks if a sell signal is present.
4. `isReliableSellSignal()`: Checks if a reliable sell signal is present.
5. `generateSignals()`: Generates trading signals based on chart data.

### Signal Generation

The `generateSignals()` function interprets the chart data and generates buy and sell signals. It assigns the generated signal to the `signal` variable and checks for different signal combinations using the `isWeakBuySignal()`, `isStrongBuySignal()`, `isSellSignal()`, and `isReliableSellSignal()` functions.

- If a strong buy signal is detected, a buy order is executed using the `trade.Buy()` function, and a message is printed.
- If a weak buy signal is detected, a message is printed.
- If a reliable sell signal is detected, a sell order is executed using the `trade.Sell()` function, and a message is printed.
- If a potential sell signal is detected, a message is printed.

### Main Program

The `OnTick()` function is the main program that is executed on each tick of the chart. It calls the `generateSignals()` function to generate trading signals.
